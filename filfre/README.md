# Get articles from filfre.net

#### filfre.net is very well written digital almanac of gaming history by Jimmy Maher (http://www.filfre.net/about-me/).
#### I want to load all articles, images (see python files) and translate it to russian language in matter of some facts:
### 1. I really like it.
### 2. I want keep my english on certain level.

MongoDB just for trying NoSQL, nothing serious.

You need the img folder in place where you start the python file.
After thousand and some hundreds images the way of linking images was changed - so, to be short, just run 'correct_images.py'
