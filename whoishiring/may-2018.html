The majority of Selerity’s applications are developed in Java and C++ on Linux but knowledge of other languages (especially Python and JavaScript), platforms and levels of the stack is very helpful.<p>Must-haves:
  * Possess a rock-solid background in Computer Science (minimum BS in Comp Sci or related field) + at least 5 years (ideally 10+) of challenging work experience.
  * Implementation of DevOps &#x2F; SRE processes at scale including continuous integration (preferred: Jenkins), automated testing, and platform monitoring (preferred: JMX, Icinga, Grafana, Graphite).
  * Demonstrated proficiency building and modifying Java and C++ applications in Linux environments (using Git, SVN). 
  * Significant operations expertise with the Ansible (preferred), Chef, or Puppet deployment automation system in a Cloud environment.<p>Interview Process:<p>If you can see yourself at Selerity, send your resume and&#x2F;or online profile (e.g. LinkedIn) to careers@selerityinc.com.  We’ll arrange a short introductory phone call and if it sounds like there’s a match we&#x27;ll arrange for you to meet the team for a full interview.<hr/>LBRY | Lead App Engineer, Blockchain Engineer, API Engineer, more | REMOTE and ONSITE (Manchester, NH)<p>LBRY is a blockchain-based protocol facilitating the discovery, distribution, and purchase of digital content.<p>This is a fancy way of saying we&#x27;ve made YouTube possible without Google and&#x2F;or are fixing BitTorrent.<p>We hire people who are smart, independent, and care about free speech and a free internet.<p>More here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbry.io&#x2F;join-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbry.io&#x2F;join-us</a><hr/>SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE<p>The story (skip this paragraph if you don&#x27;t like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, I&#x27;m now moving to Singapore for work &#x2F; personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it&#x27;s a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn&#x27;t mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity?
Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case?
If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p><i>Experience</i>: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p><i>Location</i>: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours. We are a registered employer in South Africa and Singapore, so it would be hassle-free if you&#x27;re based in those countries. If not, and if you&#x27;ve never done remote work for a foreign company before, please be sure to find out how to legally do this iin your particular country (it may involve registering as self-employed, for example).<p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put &quot;Hacker News&quot; somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.<hr/>SocialPilot | Software Engineer - node.js, react.js | REMOTE only | Full Time | Interns OK<p>SocialPilot is a social media management platform used by agencies to manage social for their clients.

The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.
