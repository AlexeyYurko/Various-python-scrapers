It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (and 90 of the 100 biggest districts) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be a full-cycle marketplace where schools can identify, purchase, integrate, and evaluate the hundreds of educational apps they&#x27;re using.<p>We\u2019re a team of about 110 (35 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Python and React.

Rumbleship solves this.<p>What We Believe\nWe believe that B2B tools should be as clean, clear, and usable as consumer tools, and we believe that the best way to build this is to have a team from all walks of life. Your experience with buying is different from anybody else\u2019s experience with buying, and it is critical to have a diversity of opinions to build the best tooling there is. Come build the last interesting thing in e-commerce.<p>Roles:<p>- Engineer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>\n- Designer: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rumbleship.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a>", "time": 1525202157, "type": "comment"}, {"by": "rsanheim", "id": 16971827, "parent": 16967543, "text": "First. | Lead Product Engineer &amp; Senior Designer | Full Time | REMOTE | Durham, NC<p>First is a venture-backed technology company at the intersection of artificial intelligence and real estate.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper\u2019s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis\u201d. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a).

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, I&#x27;m now moving to Singapore for work &#x2F; personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it&#x27;s a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn&#x27;t mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity?\nDo you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case?\nIf so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p><i>Experience</i>: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p><i>Location</i>: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours. We are a registered employer in South Africa and Singapore, so it would be hassle-free if you&#x27;re based in those countries.

With over 60 million registered users, Academia is rapidly transforming the way researchers share their work.  We\u2019re a small team of 25 people, passionate about building great software to open up science.  In 2016, we raised $11 million to fuel the growth of the platform and the team.<p>The present model for publishing academic papers is called the prestige model.  In this model, academic journals recruit professors to publish in their journal.  The paper is peer reviewed by 2 or 3 people, and then published.  This process takes 2-3 years (which is about how long it took 120-years ago).  The paper is then made available behind a paywall, and is accessible for $50-$100.  In this model, an average citizen would need to spend thousands of dollars in order to learn the latest research on any topic.<p>Academia\u2019s mission is to democratize academic publishing, making academic papers available and accessible to anyone (not just academic elites), anywhere, on any device, in any language, for free.<p>The problem with the prestige model is several fold: the paper is reviewed by only 2 or 3 people, which isn\u2019t a strong quality signal in today\u2019s world.  Only a few people (100s) actually read papers published in journals, whereas in Academia\u2019s platform, some papers get thousands of readers.  In Academia\u2019s platform, papers get &gt;69% more citations.  And, in Academia\u2019s platform publishing model, the papers are free, accessible to anyone.  <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0148257\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal....</a><p>As a result of Academia\u2019s disruptive movement into Academic publishing, we\u2019ve become the world\u2019s largest distributor of academic papers.  In addition to our over 60M registered users, we now have over 6.5M monthly actives, and over 30M unique visitors every month.<p>With the release of our Premium product, we\u2019ve gone cash flow positive; i.e. we\u2019re generating more cash than we\u2019re spending.  When our investors heard about this news, they put more money into our company (an influx of $11M in the last year).  We now have enough cash to move out of our single-threaded development model; we\u2019re deepening our free offering, and widening our revenue producing products and features.  As a result, our valuation has grown substantially.<p>Due to our cash flow positive results and these recent investments, we\u2019ve decided to grow our company.  We\u2019re 25 employees, with 17 in engineering.  We expect to double in size during the next year, so there are many interesting, exciting, and provoking technical and business challenges at our company.\nWe\u2019re located 2+ blocks from Montgomery BART in downtown San Francisco.<p>We\u2019re a Ruby on Rails shop, with React on the frontend.

The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

We have a lot of different aspects of the project that need fleshing out from audio pipline to lighting to services. Much of our current work is C, but we have work in C++, C#, Objective-C and Java as well. IOT or light embedded experience is definitely a plus: our devices rely heavily on cloud services. Linux experience is preferred, and the ideal person would be able to develop on and for both Linux and Windows, but if you have no experience with one of the two that is fine as well. About half the team uses Linux for development and the other half uses Windows.<p>Personally speaking, I have a lot of fun at work because we work on so many different types of technologies all the way from a C# service to arcane areas of Linux APIs. Another thing I like is we have no standard platform for development, so I Vim and Linux for all of my work (if you want to become our first developer primarily on OSX that&#x27;s fine with us :P).<p>If you are interested, please email your resume to me at cortanasdkresumes@microsoft.com and a short 1-3 sentences that indicate you read the post.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
